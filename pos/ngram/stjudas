When I went out to kill myself , I caught
A pack of hoodlums beating up a man .
Running to spare his suffering , I forgot
My name , my number , how my day began ,
How soldiers milled around the garden stone
And sang amusing songs ; how all that day
Their javelins measured crowds ; how I alone
Bargained the proper coins , and slipped away .

Banished from heaven , I found this victim beaten ,
Stripped , kneed , and left to cry . Dropping my rope
Aside , I ran , ignored the uniforms :
Then I remembered bread my flesh had eaten ,
The kiss that ate my flesh . Flayed without hope ,
I held the man for nothing in my arms
